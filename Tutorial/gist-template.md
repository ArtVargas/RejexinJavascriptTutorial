# Chapter 1 By Art Vargas: Matching A Hex Value Rejex

Thank you and welcome to this comprehensive tutorial in regards to understanding and following the concept of Regex which is also known as regular expressions that are used to search through various data which will then find strings that fit within a certain given parameter. Upon learning and completing this tutorial you will have an absolute clear understanding of r components which will be demonstrated with proper comprehension and vocabulary in order to give detailed explanations which can later be used to break apart components which will solely be focused on the topic of Regex being able to be assisted with hex values.



## Summary

Throughout the tutorial being demonstrated that will feature regular expressions also known as regex there will be various references and examples that will further demonstrate an analysis in regards to each regex component that will be able to provide new time coders or students with the basic understanding of all various components. The information of Hex Values will be the primary topic of discussion and study for further analysis. The knowledge stated before will showcase the use of regex being able to further assist in hexadecimal data. The standard Regex would demonstrate: /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/. The necessary Regex components such as anchors, quantifiers, grouping constructs, bracket expressions, character classes, the OR operator, flags, and character escapes will be discussed and explained for further analysis.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

A Regex anchor is the start and end of the string which makes it so the Regex matches the string we are looking for.

The anchors for our Regex are the ^ and $ characters. This will indicate that the #?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3}) between the ^ and $ is what we will be looking for in this case.

 Anchors can provide a way to limit how a regex matches a particular string by telling the regex engine where matches can begin and when they can end. With the use of anchors you will be provided with more flexibility with simple constructs that will provide a degree of control which you werenâ€™t provided with before
